I'll try to work on fixing my class and adding more details to it this week. I will not however be able to update it
until friday when I get back from work. Traveling jobs suck when you want to relax at home have to live at a hotel :P

It's all cool. This is just soemthing to add to in our free time. Anyway, I already told you
my idea for the division part: partial fractions. What ideas do you have?
